# weebpGui
This is an application designed to serve as a simple ui on top of Francesco149's Weebp CLI Programm.
CURRENTLY IT IS ONLY FOR WINDOWS AND TEST PHASE

There is an interesting CLI Programm by Francesco149  that allows you to set a background video file on Windows and Linux
this Programm is an user-interface that a will execute weebp commands in the background.
to make the programm work you will need to download mpv at (https://mpv.io/installation/) and move the mpv.exe from the 7z file into the weebp-0.6.1-library folder to work
